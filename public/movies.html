<h1>The Best Movies According to Cara</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>This is truly my guilty pleasure movie; I love the music. I am, however, a little ashamed to say I am a Hugh Jackman fan</p>

<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>Maybe I am Harvard Bias, but this movie has so many iconic/memorable scenes</p>

<h3>Catch Me if You Can</h3>
<p>I actually just saw this recently, and I am upset at how long it took me to watch this film; wow is it good</p>

<br />
<h2>Honorable Mention:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>Perhaps another Harvard bias going on here</p>
